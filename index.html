          <h3>Star Platinum</h3>
          <p>
            Star Platinum (スタープラチナ（星の白金） Sutā Purachina) is the
            Stand of Jotaro Kujo.
          </p>

            <h4>Appearence</h4>
            <p>
              Star Platinum is a humanoid Stand, resembling a tall, well-built
              man of similar proportions to Jotaro, if not more muscular. In
              colored art, its skin is often a hue between purple, blue, green,
              and small bits of gold. Its face and body have varying colors. It
              has long, flowing hair with a darker shade above its eyes and on
              the bridge of its nose, blurring the distinction between its hair
              and head. The spaces under its eyes and on its cheeks and chin are
              a darker color and divided clearly from the space around its nose
              and mouth. It wears a cap on its chin, and a metallic headband in
              three pieces, the central piece of which is shaped as a vertical
              ellipse. Initially, its facial features were very similar to
              Jotaro's.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="para" id="para2">
            <h4>Personality</h4>
            <p>
              Jotaro has described Star Platinum as very violent. It is silent,
              except when it throws punches, during which it cries "ORAORAORA"
              loudly and repeatedly. With a relatively human face, it may scowl
              and smile. It has a very malicious grin when it is first revealed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Star Platinum demonstrates a sort of interest in
              self-preservation, as seen when it halts a bullet Jotaro
              experimentally shoots at his own head,[2] protects an
              incapacitated Jotaro from DIO's attacks during Time Stop, and
              revives him from near-death by directly pumping his heart[3]
              (however, considering Star Platinum's pioneering role in the
              series, this capacity may speak primarily to the metaphysical or
              subconscious qualities of Stand users).
            </p>
            <p>
              In the original manga, Star Platinum, early on, is seen with a
              wide, disconcerting smile. Later on, Star Platinum gains Jotaro's
              stoic visage, with its future smiles only serving to warn the
              person the smile is aimed at of an imminent beating.
            </p>
            <p>
              Star Platinum is named after the TarotW card The StarW, which
              symbolizes optimism, discernment, and hope.

            <h4>Abilities</h4>
            <p>
              Star Platinum is a close-range Stand, with a basic reach of only 2
              meters from Jotaro's body, but with incredible strength, speed,
              and precision. It is one of the most powerful Stands featured in
              the series. Its overwhelming physical prowess in every basic
              characteristic, save for range, coupled with Jotaro's own
              cleverness in combat, allows Jotaro to repeatedly prevail against
              many Stand users even without the usage of any special ability. In
              addition, Jotaro's discovery of its time-stopping ability only
              made it all the more formidable in combat.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Super Strength: Star Platinum possesses immense strength, being
                able to throw a Jeep carrying four men and a girl out of the
                path of an 18-wheeler with one hand, later pulling the same Jeep
                out of a canyon with only a car as a counter-weight,[4] and
                destroy large artificial diamonds within seconds.
              </li>
              <li>
                Super Speed: Star Platinum boasts phenomenal speed. It was able
                to intercept a bullet fired from point-blank range,[2] briefly
                contended with Silver Chariot (whilst it was using Anubis),[6]
                and is stated to exceed the speed of light.
              </li>
              <li>
                Self-Preservation: Star Platinum possesses the awareness and
                reaction speed to protect Jotaro in many instances that he
                himself seems unaware; halting a bullet he experimentally shoots
                at his own head;[2] protecting him while frozen by DIO's Time
                Stop; reviving him from near-death by directly pumping his
                heart.
              </li>
              <li>
                Precision: Star Platinum is incredibly precise; it can
                surgically remove an object embedded in a person's skull without
                ill effect, catch both a bullet and a minuscule Stand like
                Lovers between his thumb and forefinger in midair, and create a
                near photo-realistic drawing of a small Egyptian fly from a
                dark, blurry photo.
              </li>
              <li>
                Enhanced Eyesight: Star Platinum utilizes eagle-like eyesight
                throughout Stardust Crusaders. Jotaro has used Star Platinum's
                eyes to see four kilometers across a desert,[9] as well as
                identify meaningful details, such as a specific type of fly in
                high-resolution images.[10] It can also follow a card shuffle
                performed by a professional gambler, subsequently recounting the
                entire new order of the deck.
              </li>
              <li>
                Enhanced Breath: Star Platinum inhales with superhuman power,
                capable of sucking in the entire fog Stand Justice and holding
                it long enough for its user to suffocate.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ora Ora Rush (突きの連打オラオララッシュ Ora Ora Rasshu, lit.
                "Barrage of Strikes"): Star Platinum's primary method of attack.
                It throws an extremely fast but precise barrage of powerful
                punches to pulverize an opponent or destroy objects.
              </li>
              <li>
                Star Finger (流星指刺スターフィンガー Sutā Fingā, lit. "Meteor
                Finger Thorn"): Star Platinum can forcibly extend its middle and
                index fingers to a length of one or two meters, allowing it to
                perform sneak attacks and stab opponents from afar.[13] The
                technique's frequency of usage decreased as the battles
                intensified.

            <h4>Star Platinum: The World</h4>
            <p>
              During the final battle with DIO in Stardust Crusaders, Star
              Platinum awakens the ability to stop time. The technique is
              referred to by Jotaro as Star Platinum: The World
              (スタープラチナ　ザ・ワールド Sutā Purachina Za Wārudo), a
              reference to the late antagonist.
            </p>
            <p>
              Time Stop When activated, Star Platinum is able to halt the flow
              of time for a brief moment, causing everything around him to
              appear frozen in place. During this time-lapse, Jotaro is able to
              interact with any object or person within his range. Measures of
              time during Time Stop correspond to normal measures, as shown by
              Jotaro's unwilling reduction in the duration of Time Stop affected
              by Made in Heaven. He is unable to use the ability consecutively,
              requiring a few seconds in between each usage.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Jotaro's prime, the ability lasted 5 seconds,[15] but decreased
              over time due to neglect from its user. Ten years after its
              initial use, Jotaro is only able to stop time for half a
              second,[16] but eventually extends it to 1-2[17] seconds
              throughout the later half of Diamond is Unbreakable.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Stone Ocean, the Stand is given the official name, Star
              Platinum: The World,[15] as well as stats that differ from the
              original Star Platinum. Despite a significant downgrade to the
              Stand's persistence, Jotaro increases the duration of the time
              stop from 2 seconds[18] back to its original 5 seconds[19] during
              the face-off at Cape Canaveral.
